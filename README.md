# python-trivia-game

## Project Overview
This project is a simple text-based trivia game developed in Python, it has a score tracking system and a total of 4 levels. With this project, I practiced structuring code into logical, reusable blocks and gained experience with user interaction and input validation.

# Details:
- **Multiple Choice**: Multiple choice system with instant feedback.
- **Lives/score tracking system**: The player is given three lives, after making three errors the game ends with failure. Lives are recorded throughout the game.
- **Level Select**: Players may choose to play any of the 4 levels at the order of their preference.
- **Redirection**: If the player selects an already completed level, the game will inform them about it and require them to select a new level.

# The code:
The Python code is uploaded to the repository here:
